          "I have developed dynamic web applications, such as the AMU PYQ Papers platform, which allows students to access previous year question papers with a user-friendly interface. This project employs Ajax for seamless frontend-backend communication, enhancing responsiveness and interactivity. Additionally, I have worked on a blog web app enabling easy CRUD operations, complete with user authentication and an admin panel for managing user interactions and feedback.",
          "Incorporating APIs into web applications is one of my core strengths. For instance, my 'Currently-Playing on Spotify' project integrates the Spotify API to display the currently playing track in real-time without page reloads. This showcases my ability to blend APIs with Ajax to create seamless and dynamic user experiences."
